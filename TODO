TODO File for ICE:
------------------
Todo before processes can be started:
* Finish scheduler (just small fixes)


When processes can start:
* Write clock-service (actually a process) and connect it to scheduler.
* Write system service which boots system up... 
* Write priority scheduling
* Add startup detection of memory, floppy, hdd etc...
* Lowlevel Memory manager (not server part)
* Add some simple IPC mechanism to protected I/O devices
